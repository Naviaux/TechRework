PLEASE NOTE: While this mod is more stable than it was in it's initial release, it is STILL recommended that you backup save files

This tree doesn't technically override the technician tree it simply replaces the tree data with a custom tree.
As a result of this, you will need to respec the technician tree before using this mod
